## Recipe

* Open a can of **pinto beans** and rinse them in a strainer.
* Throw them on a pan and let it get up to medium heat.
* Once the pan is sufficiently hot, throw in a bunch of **coconut aminos**. You want the end product to have a bit of a suacy feel (like baked beans) but also need to recognize that some of the coconut aminos will burn off due to the heat. So you want to monitor the heat to balance these needs.
* If the liquid is looking too thin, you can add a tablespoon or so of flour or cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.
* Choose some sort of spice. You don't need to make it spicy, but you need something to complement the sweetness of the coconut aminos and add flavor. **Chile paste** or any sort of **paprika**, **chile powder**, **chile flakes**, etc will do the trick. Add **salt** too, of course.
* Serve over **brown rice**, and top with **diced tomatoes**, **fresh cilantro**, **avodaco** if you wish.
