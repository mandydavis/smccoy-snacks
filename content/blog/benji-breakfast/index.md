Benji eats this way too often.

(Like almost everday.)

And in turn, I am quite familiar with this. I discovered it is fantastic post-run fuel. So salty and protein-y and healthy fatty and yummy.



## What you'll need & what to do:

* Chop **onion** and **bell peppers** and start sauteing them in a little oil.
* Add one **Trader Joe's Hash Brown** (per person eating) to the pan (or in a separate pan, whatever works. Everything will end up in the same pan in the end.)
* Do the same with **vegan sausage**.
* As everything softens up, use your spatula to break the hashbrowns and vegan sauasage into small chunks.
* Once that onions and bell peppers are cooked to your liking, and the hashbrowns are golden brown, add in your **eggs**. You probably only need 1-2 eggs per person because the hashbrowns bulk this up a bit. Mix everything together as a scramble.
* Add **salt** and **pepper** while the eggs are cooking.
* Top with **avocado** and **fresh cilantro**. Remember to fold your cilantro in half or thirds before you start chopping. This is more efficient and helps you get a finer chop.
* Optional: top with **salsa**

### Notes

Throw it in small or large torillas and make it a burrito or tacos.
