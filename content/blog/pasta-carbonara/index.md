I'm not going to copy and paste someone else's recipe here because that would be a copyright violation, but I will advocate for this dish.

I *hate* undercooked eggs ("over hard please!") so I was terrified to try this dish. However, you cannot even tell there's eggs in it because they get lost in the cheesy sauce. Dwlbo really wanted me to try this and I'm so glad we did end up making it.

This is a cheap meal that you can make feel super fancy. Pair it with wine and you've got yourself a girls night! 

Traditionally it has bacon in it, but you could easily exclude that and use peas instead (pea protein hollaaa). 

Search the interwebs for "pasta carbonara recipe" and you'll get about 35 million results——plenty to choose from.
