Sara,

I seriously cannot believe you are 21! SO grown! Seems like yesterday you were a lil freshman running around Elder and bonding over movie nights during preseason.

Oh how we've grown since then! I know that I have personally grown so much as a direct result of being your friend. I am grateful for all of the convos, runs, and Thanksgivings. I don't really know how to put into words how it has been a crazy three years and through the good moments (Boston!) and bad (Azusa/Longbeach!) we have been by each other's sides, supported one another, and kept each other sane. I truly cherish our friendship and hope we get to visit each other often as we both soon enter the next phase of our lives.

You inspire me in more ways than you know. I hope I inspire you with some more meal ideas here :P Take care of yourself, inside and out, with some nourishing, tasty food, and the people who adore you, and you'll be alright. Hope you enjoy. Visit me in Idaho thx!

xoxo
Mandy
