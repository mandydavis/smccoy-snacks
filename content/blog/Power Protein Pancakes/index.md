Y'all Kodiac Cakes are amazing, but hecka expensive. I "developed" this recipe over time as I kept making pancakes from scratch because I didn't want to spend $$ on the mix.

## Recipe (feeds two)

* Choose one or two bowls you can mix things in. You don't have to mix the dry and wet ingredients separately (I usually don't, however, this usually leads to more clumps). Ideally, you would use a large measuring cup that has a small spout so that it is less messy when you start pouring batter.
* Combine **one cup of flour** with a couple of teaspoons or so of baking powder. 
* Add in **two beaten eggs** and a solid amount of **milk**. Use whatever type of milk you have on hand, they'll all work. I mix with a rubber spatula/scraper because this will be useful later when you're trying to get one more pancake out of what's sticking to the sides.
* Keep adding liquid until you get the desired pancake batter consistency. It should be pretty thin, but not too thin to where you'll end up with crepes! I usually switch to **water** at some point. In my experience, using only milk as liquid can result in somewhat gooey/doughy pancake centers since milk is thicker than water.
* Once you have the consistency right, choose your flavor. You might add **chocolate chips**, **blueberries**, **cinnamon**, or whatever your heart desires.
* Heat a pan to medium heat and get your pancake flipping on! If you added mix-ins, be sure to mix the batter around before each pour, otherwise everything will end up in the last pancake.
* Serve with **butter** and **maple syrup**. (And coffee + fruit salad pairs really well too :P)
