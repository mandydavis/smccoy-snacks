## A fresh choice for a warm summer day!

Throw this together in a 10 minutes or less and you'll be on your way.

## Recipe:

<ul>
  <li>Add however much <strong>spinach</strong> you want to a bowl</li>
  <li>Top with some <strong>quinoa</strong> (best cold)</li>
  <li>Throw in some chopped <strong>strawberries</strong></li>
  <li>Chop up some <strong>almonds</strong> or really any other nut and throw them in. They're best if roasted. Just toss the nuts in a pan and heat them until golden. No need to add any oil or anything unless you want to.</li>
  <li><strong>Goat cheese!</strong> Add goat cheese crumbles. A great option is the Trader Joe's Honey Chevre.</li>
  <li>Make a quick <strong>dressing</strong>. Combine balsamic vinegar, honey or maple syrup, a dash of salt, and a little olive oil in a small mason jar or something. Shake it well to combine. Pour into your salad, mix it up a little, and you're good to go.</li>
</ul>

### Notes

You could totally use this as a salad template. For example, you could swap out the strawberries for peaches. Or use feta instead of goat cheese and make it more of a savory salad with more veggies.
