Everything will end up in the same pan in the end.)</li>\n<li>Once that onions and bell peppers are cooked to your liking, and the hashbrowns are golden brown, add in your eggs. You probably only need 1-2 eggs per person because the hashbrowns bulk this up a bit. Mix everything together as a scramble.</li>\n<li>Add salt and pepper while the eggs are cooking.</li>\n<li>Top with avocado and fresh cilantro. Remember to fold your cilantro in half or thirds before you start chopping. This is more efficient and helps you get a finer chop.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Benji's Breakfast Bash","date":"May 05, 2019","description":null,"thumbnail":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/breakfast-bash/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Power Protein Pancakes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Power Protein Pancakes"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/beans/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blissful Baked Beans"}}}}
