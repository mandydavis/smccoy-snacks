He knows everything about fish and fishing. He only eats buys sea fish because store bought lake fish isn’t good enough for him, since he knows how it tastes fresh. Also, I’m pretty sure tilapia is pretty cheap at the store (don’t quote me on that though). Anywho, tilapia makes the cut, so here’s the fam recipe. </p>\n<h2>Baked Lemon Pepper Tilapia for Four</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Heat oven to 375</li>\n<li>Coat bottom of 9x13 pan with <strong>spray grease</strong></li>\n<li>Lay filets (3) in the pan</li>\n<li>Sprinkle with <strong>Seafood Magic</strong> seasoning</li>\n<li>Put a pat of <strong>butter</strong> and slice of <strong>lemon</strong> on each</li>\n<li>Cover with foil for half of the time, then uncover for the other half</li>\n<li>Cook 30-35 minutes until flakes</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<p>I can’t tell you what it means for tilapia to flake. Maybe this is an opportunity for you to practice your eyeballing skills! Or maybe best to not practice with fish…? Maybe Gary can help with this one. Also, I don’t see where the pepper comes in. That is up to you to experiment with!</p>\n<blockquote>\n    “To improve taste and odor place a slice of lemon in your water...” (City of Phoenix, FAQ).\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hen's Tasty Tilapia","date":"May 03, 2019","description":null,"thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAbABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAgX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwT/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAZGUzSdZzik6UN1m1zDBH//EAB0QAAIBBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAREiEQEyL/2gAIAQEAAQUCB99mBhkURRxKQ6bUaysh3wKerV//xAAZEQADAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIQERP/2gAIAQMBAT8BqTmsaR//xAAaEQACAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQECEBMh/9oACAECAQE/Aaz1mzDP/8QAHhAAAgEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECERIhICIxYXH/2gAIAQEABj8CJdi3IUnIlV+GRW8mdP8A/8QAHBABAAIDAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBEFFh/9oACAEBAAE/IVQu4UTfWC4etnYee/UMWgC1WyFmBXOZjF9XLLZXvgagDUok/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABC83L3/xAAYEQEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhUf/aAAgBAwEBPxDQxlHVuHJ8r//EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACH/2gAIAQIBAT8QUhrOTDS6t//EAB0QAAICAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExUUFhcYH/2gAIAQEAAT8QIAyrCmKFWQSpwURY25JgS3IUr1xvCDMIOgfsBG2ZGuoTLo5ABL61Ca2Bb9j3BGwiUAmIAhIZn//Z","aspectRatio":0.7499041043344841,"src":"/static/460b099dff40612f6ec1395d84adb1e1/10fb1/ida_evan.jpg","srcSet":"/static/460b099dff40612f6ec1395d84adb1e1/467b3/ida_evan.jpg 340w,\n/static/460b099dff40612f6ec1395d84adb1e1/e1ddd/ida_evan.jpg 680w,\n/static/460b099dff40612f6ec1395d84adb1e1/10fb1/ida_evan.jpg 1360w,\n/static/460b099dff40612f6ec1395d84adb1e1/08f1f/ida_evan.jpg 1955w","sizes":"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Hen's Tasty Tilapia/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Message from Mandy/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Message from Mandy"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Power Protein Pancakes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Power Protein Pancakes"}}}}
