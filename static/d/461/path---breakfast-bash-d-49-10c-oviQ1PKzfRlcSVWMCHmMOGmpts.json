I discovered it is fantastic post-run fuel. So salty and protein-y and healthy fatty and yummy.</p>\n<h2>What you’ll need &#x26; what to do:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Chop <strong>onion</strong> and <strong>bell peppers</strong> and start sauteing them in a little oil.</li>\n<li>Add one <strong>Trader Joe’s Hash Brown</strong> (per person eating) to the pan (or in a separate pan, whatever works. Everything will end up in the same pan in the end.)</li>\n<li>Do the same with <strong>vegan sausage</strong>.</li>\n<li>As everything softens up, use your spatula to break the hashbrowns and vegan sauasage into small chunks.</li>\n<li>Once that onions and bell peppers are cooked to your liking, and the hashbrowns are golden brown, add in your <strong>eggs</strong>. You probably only need 1-2 eggs per person because the hashbrowns bulk this up a bit. Mix everything together as a scramble.</li>\n<li>Add <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong> while the eggs are cooking.</li>\n<li>Top with <strong>avocado</strong> and <strong>fresh cilantro</strong>. Remember to fold your cilantro in half or thirds before you start chopping. This is more efficient and helps you get a finer chop.</li>\n<li>Optional: top with <strong>salsa</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n<p>Throw it in small or large torillas and make it a burrito or tacos. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Benji's Breakfast Bash","date":"May 05, 2019","description":"Benji's go-to breakfast","thumbnail":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/breakfast-bash/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Power Protein Pancakes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Power Protein Pancakes"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/beans/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blissful Baked Beans"}}}}
